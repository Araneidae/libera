Current problems

 - Events are being missed.
Not too often, but often enough worry about.  Perhaps the events thread
wants to run at a higher priority: which would be a good idea anyway.

Look into using Posix thread priority scheduling, see (this will only work
for 3.14.8+):

There is a new user option USE_POSIX_THREAD_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in the
CONFIG_SITE configure file for using POSIX thread priority scheduling. For now
the default value is NO. This has only been tested on a few versions of linux.
On linux, in order, to use real time priorities the option must be set to YES
and the ioc must be started with root privilages.
