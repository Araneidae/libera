Work to do

* Create proper documentation

* Investigate migrating to soft floating point: use -msoft-float and recompile
  libgcc.a.  This will affect EPICS.

* Make first turn mode more friendly if the intermediate frequency isn't close
  to 1/4 f_s.

* Sort out scaling between SA:CURRENT and FT:CHARGE.
