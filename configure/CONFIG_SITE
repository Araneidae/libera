CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS += linux-arm
#       Typically targets Libera systems with firmware 1.46 to 1.82,
#       targeting glibc 2.3.2 on Libera.  The recommended build here is to
#       use gcc 3.4.4 and glibc 2.3.6 -- this toolchain was built using
#       crosstool.
#
CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS += linux-arm_el
#       Targets newer Libera systems using the ARM "embedded" EABI.  At 
#       Diamond we target glibc 2.7 using gcc 4.3.2 with a toolchain built
#       using crosstool-ng, however there is no reason not to use this target
#       with the standard iTech toolchain.
#
CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS += linux-arm_el-2_3
#       This is a compatibility target used to target glibc 2.3.6 on Libera
#       2.00 when using linux-arm_gnueabi to build to target the Diamond
#       system.  Libera 2.00 also uses EABI, but the older glibc is subtly
#       incompatible with glibc 2.7 builds.  The toolchain used here was
#       extracted from
#           scratchbox-toolchain-arm-linux-cs344-2.3_1.0.4_i386.deb  
#       downloaded from
#           http://scratchbox.org/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/

# Identifies either the path to the IOC builder python library or its
# pkg_resources version identification.  Very simple test: if it begins with /
# it's a path!  If this is left blank then the builder is assumed to be on the
# path.
#    Note: if the IOC builder is not installed, please place the prebuilt .db
# files in the liberaApp/Db directory to avoid any need to invoke this.
