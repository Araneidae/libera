Epics driver for Libera Electron Beam Position Monitor (EBPM)
=============================================================

This software provides an EPICS interface to the Libera electron beam position
monitor, allowing the performance of the electron beam to be monitored through
epics channels.

This version of the epics driver is designed to work with with version 1.20 or
1.21 of the Libera device driver, as distributed by Instrumentation
Technologies, http://www.i-tech.si, and has been built to support the
comissioning of the Diamond light source, http://diamond.ac.uk.

The normal distribution point for this software is Sourceforge, from URL
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libera-epics
The author, Dr. Michael Abbott, can be contacted at Diamond Light Source at
michael.abbott@diamond.ac.uk.

This release of the Libera EPICS driver provides the following functionality:

First Turn Data
    This is designed for monitoring transfer paths and behaviour during
    injection of the first turn into a synchrotron.  A hardware trigger is
    required a few microseconds before the event.

Turn-by-turn Data
    Very long waveforms (up to 524,288 points) can be captured on a hardware
    trigger and then read out in 16384 point segments.  This is designed
    specifically for tune measurements at frequencies up to 1/2 the
    synchrotron revolution frequency.

Booster Ramp Data
    Waveforms are provided giving an overview of the booster ramp.  This is
    done by reducing 100ms of ramp data to two sample rates: 1/1024 turn
    frequency, and 1/64 turn frequency.

Slow Acquisition Data
    The electron beam position is filtered down to an update rate of 10Hz.
    Automatic button switching should be enabled for high precision slow
    acquisition data.

Interlock Control
    A hardware interlock output is generated by Libera to confirm that the
    electron beam position is within a configured window: this is designed for
    machine protection.


All EPICS records follow a uniform naming convention of the form
    <device>:<group>:<record>
where:
    <device> is normally derived from the hostname of the epics IOC, but can
        be configured to any string at startup.  
    <group> is the major function (FT = "First Turn", etc)
    <record> is the remainder of the record name as specified below.

In the list of records below we use a number of abbreviations:
    <iq>
        refers to eight names AI, AQ, BI, BQ, CI, CQ, DI, CQ referring to
        button values in quadrature (typically at turn-by-turn rate).
    <buttons> 
        refers to four names, A, B, C, D, referring to the four beam position
        monitor buttons.
    <positions> 
        refers to four names, X, Y, Q, S referring to the computed electron
        beam position (X,Y), a skew factor (Q) and the total beam intensity
        (S).  The intensity S is in arbitrary units, normally scaled to
        0.5822*2^31 full scale; the positions are in either nm or mm. 
    ..._S
        Records of the form <name>_S are used to write values into the driver.
        

The following EPICS records provided by this driver will be of interest:


First Turn (<group> = FT):
==========================

    WF<buttons>
        256 point arrays at approximately 32ns sampling interval, updated on
        trigger
    <buttons>
        Button values integrated within the window specified by OFF and LEN.
    <positions>
        Position data derived from <buttons>, in mm.
    OFF_S, LEN_S
        These two fields determine the window within WF<buttons> used to
        compute the integrated <buttons> values.
    ENABLE_S
        If set to Disabled then FT processing will not occur.
    CHARGE
        Train charge as integrated within the integration window, and scaled
        by CF:ISCALE.


Free Running (<group> = FR):
============================

    WF<iq>
    WF<buttons>
    WF<positions>
        2048 point arrays updated on each trigger at turn-by-turn frequency.
    ENABLE_S
        If set to Disabled then FR processing will not occur.


Turn by Turn (<group> = TT):
============================

    ARM
        1 must be written to this record to enable capture of a full
        turn-by-turn waveform at the next trigger.
    READY
        This record becomes set to 1 when a waveform has been captured.
    CAPLEN
        Programs the number of points to be captured into the internal long
        waveform.  A maximum of 524,288 points can be specified.
    CAPTURED
        Records how many points were captured.  At Diamond's booster frequency
        (1.893MHz) something over 524,288 points can be reliably captured.
    OFFSET_S, OFFSET
        Used to set the offset into the long buffer for reading out waveforms,
        together with readback used for synchronisation.
    LENGTH_S
        Used to set how many points are read from the long buffer.  The
        default (and maximum) value is 16384.
    WF<buttons>, WF<positions>
        Waveforms of up to 1024 points read from the internal captured long
        waveform using the specified OFFSET and LENGTH.

The following protocol should be used when using this group of records.
First the record must be armed, and then the trigger should be waited for.
Segments should then be read by writing the offset and waiting for it to
update before reading.  To be explicit:

Triggering:
    - Write desired capture length to CAPLEN_S
    - Write 0 to READY and wait for READY == 0
    - Write 1 to ARM
    - Wait until READY == 1

Reading:
    - Write <offset> to OFFSET_S
    - Wait until OFFSET == <offset>
    - Read desired waveforms

If CAPLEN > 16384 then the reading process should be repeated with <offset>
set to 0, 16384, 32768, etc until the entire desired waveform has been
retrieved.


Booster (<group> = BN):
=======================

    WF<buttons>, WF<positions>
        3040 point waveforms of the 100ms booster ramp at booster turn-by-turn
        frequency reduced by 64.
    WFS<positions>
        190 point waveforms of the 100ms booster ramp reduced by a factor of
        1024 from turn-by-turn frequency.
    ENABLE_S
        If set to Disabled then BN processing will not occur.


Slow Acquisition (<group> = SA):
================================

    <buttons>
    <positions>
        Averaged button readings and positions updating at approximately 10Hz.

    POWER
        Absolute input power in dBm.  The scaling here is hard-wired and not
        especially accurate.

    CURRENT
        Beam current.  This is scaled by CF:ISCALE.


Interlock Control (<group> = IL):
=================================

    ENABLE_S
        If this is set to Disabled the interlock output is held active, or
        closed (unless OVERFLOW_S is also set to Enabled to enable overflow
        detection).  When set to Enabled the interlock output is only active
        while the beam position lies within the interlock window.
    MINX_S, MAXX_S, MINY_S, MAXY_S
        Interlock window: when the interlock is enabled the interlock output
        is closed ("active") so long as the beam position lies within this
        window. 
    OVER_S, TIME_S
        ADC overflow detection parameters: the interlock is dropped if the ADC
        input exceeds value OVER for at least TIME samples.
    OVERFLOW_S
        This can be set to Enabled to enable ADC overflow detection even when
        the interlock is otherwise disabled.
    ILIMIT_S
        The interlock will automatically Enabled when the beam current,
        measured by SA:CURRENT, exceeds this value.
    STATE, LATCH
        STATE records whether the interlock is currently dropped or has been
        dropped within the last 0.5 seconds.  LATCH is set if the interlock
        has been dropped at any time since it was last reset.


Configuration (<group> = CF):
=============================

    DIAG_S
        Configures button or stripline orientation
    KX_S, KY_S, KQ_S
        Scaling factor in mm.  These are determined by the physical geometry
        of the button or stripline pickups.  At Diamond typical values are
        17mm for the transfer path striplines and 10.6mm and 11mm (horizontal
        and vertical) for the booster buttons.
    X0_S, Y0_S
        Zero point offsets.  It is intended that these can be used to define a
        logical "centre" point once the centre of the focusing system has been
        located precisely.
    G0_S, G1_S, G2_S, G3_S
        Gain offsets can be set for individual RF channels to compensate for
        channel imbalances within Libera.  This is only used in FT mode.
    AUTOSW_S
        Controls automatic cycling of switches with DSC (Digital Signal
        Conditioning), for sub-kHz position measurements, or fixed switch
        positions for high frequency measurements.
    SETSW_S
        Switch position to use when AUTOSW_S is set to Fixed.
    ATTEN_S
        Attenuator settings in dB: a value between 0 and 62dB can be set.
    ISCALE_S
        Nominal beam current at 0dBm input power as seen by Libera.  This is
        used to compute SA:CURRENT and FT:CHARGE.


Sensors (<group> = SE):
=======================

    TEMP
        Internal temperature of Libera system.  This should normally be
        maintained below approximately 45 degrees centigrade.

    FAN1, FAN2
        Internal fan speeds, normally running at around 4000-5000 RPM.

    FREE, RAMFS
        FREE records free memory available, while RAMFS records how much
        memory is currently allocated in temporary files.  RAMFS should be
        monitored to ensure that log files (in /var/log) don't consume all
        available memory.

    CPU
        CPU usage as a percentage.

    HEALTH
        Aggregates the alarm status of all of the above sensors.  Only the
        alarm state of this record is significant.
        
    UPTIME
        Time since Libera was last rebooted in hours.



Other (no group):
