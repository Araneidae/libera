# This script inspects /lib and the local bin directory to try and figure out
# which architecture is the most appropriate match.
#
# This script must be called with SOURCE set to point to the root installation
# directory containing the bin directories.
#
# The following environment variables are set by this script:
#
#   EPICS_ARCH
#       Name of EPICS architecture to run on this target, one of:
#           linux-arm           Original architecture
#           linux-arm_el        Libera with EABI installed
#           linux-arm_el-2_3    Compatibility EABI library versions
#
#   CONFIGDIR
#       Location of libera and IOC configuration files, one of:
#           /etc/sysconfig      The original configuration file location
#           /etc/default        The current iTech standard
#           /etc/libera         The Diamond standard
#
#   ROOTFS_ARCH
#       Basic rootfs architecture.  This is set at the same time as
#       CONFIGDIR, and tracks exactly the same information.
#           ITECH-v0            iTech release 1.46
#           ITECH-v1            iTech release 1.60 to 1.82
#           ITECH-v2            iTech release 2.00 and later
#           DLS                 DLS rootfs
