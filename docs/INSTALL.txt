This binary distribution of the Libera Electron Beam Position Monitor EPICS
driver contains the following directories:

ioc
    This is the complete installation ready to be deployed on the target
    system.  See instructions below for installation.

    Documentation, including this file.

opi
    EDM control screens for managing the EPICS interface to each Libera.  It
    should be possible to use all the files in opi/libera without
    modification, but other files will need to be customised to the
    appropriate target environment.


To install the Libera EPICS driver follow these steps:

1.  Copy the entire ioc directory somewhere that the Libera IOC can see it.
Ideally an nfs mount point should be created and mounted on the Libera.  In
the following I'll assume this directory has been copied to a directory named
    /mnt/nfs/ioc
on Libera.

2.  Modify the file ioc/install/CONFIG to suit your target if necessary.

3.  Run the command:
    /mnt/nfs/ioc/install_d/libera-install-ioc -h
to see the possible installation options.  Normally installation should be
performed using the command
    /mnt/nfs/ioc/install_d/libera-install-ioc -fas SR
This will ensure that all the necessary files are copied to the Libera (-f),
the IOC is started automatically when Libera is rebooted (-a), and the IOC is
started immediately (-s).  If necessary use -w on newer versions of Libera.

Note that simply copying files onto Libera won't work properly, though the IOC
can be run interactively after a successful install by running the command
    /mnt/nfs/ioc/runioc
This is designed for testing and development only.


To manage the IOC there are three scripts, each of which can be run with one
argument, any of start, stop or restart.

/etc/init.d/healthd
    This starts and stops the health daemon, which should normally be left
    running.  The libera-driver script will not run if the health daemon is
    not running.

/etc/init.d/libera-driver
    This starts starts and stops all the Libera driver daemons, including the
    IOC if -a was specified as part of the installation.

/etc/init.d/epics
    This starts and stops the EPICS IOC without disturbing the driver or the
    clock PLL daemon.  This is normally called automatically by the
    libera-driver script.

After installation the original /etc/init.d/libera script is renamed to
/etc/init.d/old-libera.  This script should no longer be used and can be
deleted if desired.
