Building and Releasing Libera
=============================

This document describes the internal process used within the Diamond Controls
group to manage the development and deployment of the Libera EPICS driver, and
is linked to directly from the Controls ``Application Development
Environment'' (ADE) document.

The following ADE standard file system locations are used to manage Libera:

`$SVN_ROOT/diamond/trunk/ioc/Libera`::
Current development version of Libera EPICS driver.

`$SVN_ROOT/diamond/release/ioc/Libera`::
Versioned releases of Libera EPICS driver.  Note that since around version
1.46 the Libere EPICS driver version numbers have tended to shadow the
corresponding Instrumentation Technology releases, but with our own extra
sub-version numbering.

`/dls_sw/proc/R3.14.`{`9`,`11`}`/ioc/Libera`::
Currently all official releases of the Libera IOC are under these two
directories.  Releases up to and including 2.00.0 are stored under `R3.14.9`,
releases 2.05 and onwards under `R3.14.11`.
+
The directory path to the current release, eg
`/dls_sw/prod/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera/2.05.3`, should be configured in
`configure-ioc` against the key `DI-EBPM-gui-dir`.  This allows the `diagOpi`
EDM screens to find the correct Libera screens.

`/dls_sw/cs-publish/libera`::
Publicly available released of Libera are made available through the external
web site http://controls.diamond.ac.uk/downloads/libera/index.html[].  The
content of this web site is managed through this directory, as documented
below.

In the Libera source tree there is detailed documentation in the `docs`
directory, including the following:

`INSTALL.txt`::
Installation instructions for binary distributions downloaded from the
external web site.

`BUILD.txt`::
Detailed build instructions, again designed for external users of the EPICS
driver, but the build process is documented here.

`libera.`{`txt`,`html`}::
Detailed operational documentation of the EPICS interface to Libera.

`CHANGES.`{`txt`,`html`}::
Log of changes to the EPICS driver.  Designed to provide an overview of the
changes so that external users can get an understanding of the differences
between releases.

`process.`{`txt`,`html`}::
This document.


Releasing the Libera EPICS driver
---------------------------------  

To create a new release of the Libera EPICS driver the following process
should be followed:

1. Check out the current sources from subversion.

2. Modify the `VERSION` line of `install_d/CONFIG` during development.  The
version number should be advanced, and the suffix `-dev` added until the final
release can be made.

3. Update the Libera EPICS driver, test it using the resources in the lab,
possibly test it using test installations (described below) on one or more
Liberas in the synchrotron, ensure the final version of the sources is
commited to SVN.

4. Ensure the documentation in `libera.txt` and `CHANGES.txt` is up to date,
remove the `-dev` suffix from the `VERSION` string, and commit the final
release to trunk.

5. To create a production release the script `install_d/publish-release`
should be used.  Give it one argument, the version string for the new release,
and this script will automatically create a versioned release under subversion
and build it under `/dls_sw/prod/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera`.

6. The newly released driver can then be installed on all Liberas in the
storage ring using the installation procedure documented below.

7. Finally the IOC redirector needs to be reconfigured for the
`DI-EBPM-gui-dir` key so that fresh launches of the Diagnostics screens will
pick up the new Libera screens.  This is done by running the following
command (where `$VERSION` is the new driver version string).
+
----
configure-ioc e -f DI-EBPM-gui-dir /dls_sw/proc/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera/$VERSION
----


Publishing the Libera EPICS driver
----------------------------------

After creating a new release of the Libera IOC it should be released to the
public web site.  This requires the following steps.

1. Prepare a binary release by running the following command:
+
----
install_d/distribute -b $VERSION /tmp
----
+
This will create two files `libera-epics-$VERSION.tar.gz` and
`libera-epics-$VERSION-install.tar.gz` in `/tmp`.  The first is the source
distribution, the second the binary installation.

2. Place the source distribution in `/dls_sw/cs-publish/libera/src/` and the
binary install in `/dls_sw/cs-publish/libera/install/`.

3. Run `make -C docs` in the current Libera sources and copy the generated
files `CHANGES.html` and `libera.html` from `docs` to
`/dls_sw/cs-publish/libera`.

4. Edit the index file `/dls_sw/cs-publish/libera/index.html` to add a new row
for the newly created release.
+
The new release is now live.


Installing and Managing Libera
------------------------------

The processes for upgrading the Libera EPICS IOC in the lab and in the
synchrotron are somewhat different.  Typically only a single machine is
managed in the lab, though a script `lab-liberas` is provided for managing
groups of lab machines.  Upgrades on the synchrotron are a more delicate
process, as a guaranteed upgrade is mandatory!


Testing the Libera EPICS IOC in the Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a build from sources is complete, the command `install_d/install-ioc`
(without any arguments) will place a copy of the installation binaries (and
all associated files) in `/home/libera/nfs/testing/ioc`.

To connect to a properly configured lab machine the command (where `$NN` is a
two digit number, typically in the range 01 to 07)

----
ssh -x root@TS-DI-EBPM-$NN
----

will serve.  The root password is not documented here, but it is well known,
and ssh certificates can be set up to facilitate connection.  The `-x` option
prevents bogus error messages of the form `sh: /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth: not
found`.

Once connected to a test machine, if the EPICS driver is already configured as
a test install, the newly built driver can be started by running the command
`/etc/init.d/epics restart` or `/etc/init.d/libera-driver restart` if a fuller
restart is required.

Alternatively, the interactive EPICS IOC shell can be started by running the
following commands:

----
/etc/init.d/epics stop
/mnt/nfs/testing/ioc/runioc
----

If the EPICS driver is not installed, if a production install is running, or
if locally installed files have changed, then the EPICS driver can be
installed as a test install by running the following command (the `-s` option
also forces the driver to start after installation is complete, `-h` can be
used for a list of options):

----
/mnt/nfs/testing/ioc/install_d/libera-install-ioc -tasw SR
----

The installation, whether test (`-t`) or final (`-f`) updates the
configuration file `/etc/libera/epics_ioc` (which can be found in
`/etc/default` or `/etc/sysconfig` on older versions of Libera), places the
scripts `epics`, `healthd`, `libera-driver` in `/etc/init.d` and manages
autostart links in `/etc/rc.d`.


Installing the Libera EPICS driver on the Synchrotron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrading the Libera EPICS IOC on the synchrotron involves three steps:

1. Preparing the files to be installed
2. Ensuring the NFS mounts are working correctly
3. Performing the upgrade.

The operations below use the command `liberas` which can be found in the
`toolkit` directory of the Libera source tree.

Preparing the files to be installed::

Preparing the files to be installed is straightforward.  If a properly
released production install is to be used then after a successful build all
the required files will already be present in
`/dls_sw/prod/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera/$VERSION`.  If on the other hand a test
install is required then the command
+
----
install_d/install-ioc /dls_sw/work/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera
----
+
should be run in the build source directory tree.


Ensuring the NFS mounts are working correctly::

This step is vital for a smoothly running install, as there is no guarantee
that Libera can currently see the NFS mount points needed for the
installation.  The following procedure will ensure that the upgrade will work
smoothly.
+
--
* First check that all liberas in the synchrotron are responding by running the
command
+
----
liberas '' hostname | wc -l
----
+
At the time of writing this should return the number 105 after not too long a
delay.  If not this must be investigated and sorted out before proceeding
further.

* Next check that the NFS mounts are present.  The following command will
print out the name of all liberas where the `/dls_sw/prod` mount point is
missing:
+
----
liberas -w '' '[ -d /mnt/prod/R3.14.11 ] || hostname'
----
+
If this reports nothing (and returns to the prompt) then all is well and the
installation can be done. 

* Recovering the nfs mounts.  (needs documenting)
--

Performing the upgrade::

This step is very easy.  Simply run the following two commands where
`$INSTALL` is either `/mnt/prod/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera/$VERSION` or
`/mnt/work/R3.14.11/ioc/Libera/ioc`. 
+
----
liberas -w 'LB|BR|BS' "$INSTALL/install_d/libera-install-ioc -fasw BO"
liberas -w SR "$INSTALL/install_d/libera-install-ioc -fasw SR"
----


Moving Liberas between the Lab and the Synchrotron Building
-----------------------------------------------------------

This needs to be documented.
