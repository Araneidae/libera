Work to do

* Add controls for disabling unwanted functionality

* Review event handling

* Implement autosave and restore

* Review configuration handling

* Try to create proper release process

* Update hardware description document

* Create proper documentation

* Implement full CSPI hardware interface.

* Review convert interface.  Separate out gain correction and ensure that this
  is implemented for FT and SA.

* Investigate migrating to soft floating point: use -msoft-float and recompile
  libgcc.a.  This will affect EPICS.

* Remove hard-coded RF frequency in booster.cpp


Notes:

- Event handling is all over the place!
