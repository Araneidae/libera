Change history of Libera EPICS Driver development

2006/02/06 Version 0.2  
First published release, supporting Libera 0.92-2 driver only.


2006/03/13 Version 0.4
Works with Libera 1.00

Major changes:
 - Uses Libera 1.00 driver, uses CSPI library interface, now cooperates with
   leventd!
 - Implements support for adc rate buffer and slow acquisition.
 - Unprocessed I/Q data now exposed through EPICS interface.
 - Separated out turn-by-turn processing into separate long capture and free
   running modes
 - Conversion routines now much more efficient (cordic in 135ns!)
 - Buffer and capture lengths can now be configured at startup time.
 - Persistent state now supported for basic configuration parameters.

The following incompatible changes with the previous release should be noted:

 - The FT (first turn) buffer is now sampled at 32ns intervals rather than at
   turn-by-turn rate.  The default sample window has also been changed
   accordingly.

 - The "free running" trigger mode for TT (turn-by-turn) capture is no longer
   supported, instead a separate FR (free running) mode is provided.

 - The file /etc/sysconfig/epics_ioc now contains important startup
   configuration information which must be provided before the IOC will start.
   
 - The loading of initial configuration has changed.  IOC_STATE_PATH should be
   defined appropriately and an initial configuration can be written through
   the EPICS interface.
