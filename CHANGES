Change history of Libera EPICS Driver development

2006/08/17 Version 0.6.1
========================
Works with Libera 1.21 

Significant changes:
 - Automatic switching and DSC (digital signal conditioning) can now be
   switched on or off.  This should normally be on when accurate slow
   acquisition (and fast feedback) data is required, and should be off for
   first turn and turn by turn data. 
 - The machine protection interlock can now be controlled and configured.
 - Slow acquisition mode now estimates beam current.
 - First turn now estimates charge in measured bunch train.
 - More detailed monitoring of Libera status, including accurate free memory,
   ram disk usage, cpu consumption.
 - IQ data available for decimated /64 waveforms.

Minor changes:
 - Added toolkit files.
 - Sensor PVs (temperature, fan speeds etcetera) reimplemented and renamed.
 - Descriptions added to all records.
 - Configuration readback PVs now removed.
 - Significant rearrangements of code, together with necessary changes to
   track substantial changes in CSPI interface.
 - ai/ao records now perform conversion to floating point in the EPICS layer.


2006/07/06 Version 0.5
======================
Works with Libera 1.00 iTech drivers

Note that the description of the installation process in INSTALL has changed:
this release includes scripts to run on Libera to automate part of this
install process.

Significant changes:
 - New HEALTH record which collects together alarm severities for temperature,
   fans and free memory.
 - New TICK record which records time since last processed trigger and records
   an alarm status after 1 and 10 seconds.
 - Redefine orientation of vertical mode: button/stripline B is now deemed to
   be in the *negative* X direction.  This makes the logic consistent with
   conventions at Diamond.
 - Postmortem support now enabled: this seems to work ok with the latest
   drivers from iTech.
 - New libera-install-ioc and libera-install-epics scripts.  These can be
   used to install the epics libraries and Libera EPICS driver on the IOC.
   Note that the INSTALL instructions have changed to reflect this.
 - `/etc/init.d/epics stop` script now copes if the driver has locked up and
   forcibly kills it if necessary.
 - EDM control screens now included in this distribution.

Minor changes:
 - Temperature, fan and memory alarm limits defined.  Memory records USED and
   CACHE withdrawn (still looking for a good measure of free memory).  Unused
   TEMP2 record also deleted.
 - Change implementation of interlocking with EPICS layer, used to rule out
   the EPICS layer from any involvement with Libera lockups (it is clear now
   that these occur in the iTech driver).
 - Remove rather arbitrary limits on TT, TW, FR and BN IOC configuration
   parameters: if the installer insists on killing the IOC by setting
   unreasonable values, be my guest.


2006/03/13 Version 0.4
======================
Works with Libera 1.00

Major changes:
 - Uses Libera 1.00 driver, uses CSPI library interface, now cooperates with
   leventd!
 - Implements support for adc rate buffer and slow acquisition.
 - Unprocessed I/Q data now exposed through EPICS interface.
 - Separated out turn-by-turn processing into separate long capture and free
   running modes
 - Conversion routines now much more efficient (cordic in 135ns!)
 - Buffer and capture lengths can now be configured at startup time.
 - Persistent state now supported for basic configuration parameters.

The following incompatible changes with the previous release should be noted:

 - The FT (first turn) buffer is now sampled at 32ns intervals rather than at
   turn-by-turn rate.  The default sample window has also been changed
   accordingly.

 - The "free running" trigger mode for TT (turn-by-turn) capture is no longer
   supported, instead a separate FR (free running) mode is provided.

 - The file /etc/sysconfig/epics_ioc now contains important startup
   configuration information which must be provided before the IOC will start.
   
 - The loading of initial configuration has changed.  IOC_STATE_PATH should be
   defined appropriately and an initial configuration can be written through
   the EPICS interface.


2006/02/06 Version 0.2
======================  
First published release, supporting Libera 0.92-2 driver only.
