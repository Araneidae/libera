# This file contains definitions of the target directories used for building

# Version number of this software: automatically included in build and used
# to build distribution files.
VERSION=2.05.6-dev

# This is where installed files will be placed ready for deployment to the
# Libera IOC.  The IOC files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/ioc and the
# EPICS run-time files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/epics.
INSTALL_HOST=/home/libera/nfs/testing


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The remaining definitions are IOC specific parameters used to configure the
# running of the IOC.
#
# All symbols beginning IOC_ will be written to the IOC configuration file
# which is stored to /etc/sysconfig/epics_ioc on Libera.
#
# All symbols beginning xx_IOC_ (where xx is any two character sequence) are
# installation location specific.


# The IOC normally runs as a daemon with output redirected to this file.
# We now send all IOC logging to the IOC console.
IOC_LOG=/dev/console
# For the prebuilt distribution we override the default, as most users won't be
# happy with logging disappearing off to the console!
DIST_IOC_LOG=/var/log/ioc

# Where to put core dumps
#IOC_CORE=/mnt/nfs/testing/cores

# Location where the IOC will look for its persistent state.
IOC_STATE_PATH=/opt/state
# Set this to 1 to enable remounting the rootfs every time the state file is
# written.  This is really not a great idea, by the way -- it would be *much*
# better to have a writable file system mounted over /opt/state.
IOC_REMOUNT_ROOTFS=0

# Length of Booster ramp to be monitored in units of 1024 turn-by-turn
# samples.  Different ramp lengths are appropriate in the storage ring and
# the booster: need to ensure that this length is less than the interval
# between triggers.
BO_IOC_BN_LENGTH=190
SR_IOC_BN_LENGTH=60

# This determines how long a buffer will be used by signal conditioning:
# multiply this by 8*NTBT (in the libera file on the IOC) to get the total
# number of turns that will be sampled.  This should be set to at least 2,
# and too large a value can be unhelpful.
BO_IOC_SC_LENGTH=3
SR_IOC_SC_LENGTH=6

# Maximum number of points to be captured in a single long turn-by-turn
# waveform.  This will consume 32 bytes per point, so don't set it too long!
# A TT buffer of 0.5M samples is a good practical limit: this consumes 16MB
# of RAM, which we can afford, and gives us 0.5s of storage ring turn-by-turn
# data, which is ample.
IOC_TT_LENGTH=524288

# Turn by turn readout window length.  A large readout window helps speed up
# transfers, but increased the memory footprint.  The values of
# IOC_TT_LENGTH=2^19, IOC_TT_WINDOW=2^17 leave enough working memory
IOC_TT_WINDOW=131072

# Turn by turn small waveform length (continuously updating TT data).
IOC_FR_LENGTH=2048


# The following two parameters are used to configure the internal scaling
# used by Libera to convert measured signal intensities into power, current
# and charge.
#    Both numbers are designed to be measured with 0dBm continuous wave RF
# inputs into all four buttons with attenuation set to 45dB
#
#    Set IOC_S0_SA to the value returned by the PV :SA:S
#
#    For first turn first set :FT:OFF_S to 0 and :FT:LEN_S to 256 and
#    then set IOC_S0_FT to the value of :FT:S/:FT:LEN_S.
#
# Of course this measurement can be done with different powers and different
# attenuations, in which case it should be compensated accordingly.  For a
# measurement of S(P,A) at power P (in dBm) and attenuation A (in dB) compute
#
#            A - 45 - P
#            ----------
#                20
#    S_0 = 10           * S(P,A)  .
#
# Note that there is little point in striving for much more than two
# significant figures in these values, and the same settings should serve for
# all Liberas with the same filter chain configuration.  Changing the
# configured DDC filters will change the SA value.
#
# An annoying complication is that the settings for Electron and Brilliance
# are very different, so we have both here and the appropriate one is
# selected during installation from the computed instrument type

# By default the IOC monitors the local NTP daemon (through the SNTP RFC 2030
# interface) and aggregates its status into the clock health PV.  If however,
# NFS is not installed, or the NTP daemon does not provide this interface,
# this can be disabled by setting this variable to 0.
