# env.conf: sample Libera environment configuration file
#           usage: ./libera --set-environment < env.conf

# A configuration file should consist of parameters of a form:
# NAME VALUE

# The configuration file is line-based - that is, each newline-
# terminated line represents either a comment, or a parameter.
# Parameter names are case sensitive. Leading and trailing
# whitespace in parameter names and values is irrelevant and
# discarded. Any line beginning with a hash ('#') character is
# ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.
