# This is where installed files will be placed ready for deployment to the
# Libera IOC.  The IOC files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/ioc and the
# EPICS run-time files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/epics.

# The remaining definitions are IOC specific parameters used to configure the
# running of the IOC.
#
# All symbols beginning IOC_ will be written to the IOC configuration file
# which is stored to /etc/sysconfig/epics_ioc on Libera.
#
# All symbols beginning xx_IOC_ (where xx is any two character sequence) are
# installation location specific.


# The IOC normally runs as a daemon with output redirected to this file.

# Length of Booster ramp to be monitored in units of 1024 turn-by-turn
# samples.  Different ramp lengths are appropriate in the storage ring and
# the booster: need to ensure that this length is less than the interval

# Maximum number of points to be captured in a single long turn-by-turn
# waveform.  This will consume 32 bytes per point, so don't set it too long!
# A TT buffer of 0.5M samples is a good practical limit: this consumes 16MB
# of RAM, which we can afford, and gives us 0.5s of storage ring turn-by-turn
# data, which is ample.

# Turn by turn small waveform length (continuously updating TT data).

# The following two parameters are used to configure the internal scaling
# used by Libera to convert measured signal intensities into power, current
# and charge.  
#    Both numbers are designed to be measured with 0dBm continuous wave RF
# inputs into all four buttons with attenuation set to 45dB
#
#    Set IOC_S0_SA to the value returned by the PV :SA:S
#
#    For first turn first set :FT:OFF_S to 0 and :FT:LEN_S to 256 and
#    then set IOC_S0_FT to the value of :FT:S/:FT:LEN_S.
#
# Of course this measurement can be done with different powers and different
# attenuations, in which case it should be compensated accordingly.  For a
# measurement of S(P,A) at power P (in dBm) and attenuation A (in dB) compute
#
#            A - 45 - P
#            ----------
#                20
#    S_0 = 10           * S(P,A)  .
#
# Note that there is little point in striving for much more than two
# significant figures in these values, and the same settings should serve for
# all Liberas with the same filter chain configuration.  Changing the
# configured DDC filters will change these values.
