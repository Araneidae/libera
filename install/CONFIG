# This is where installed files will be placed ready for deployment to the
# Libera IOC.  The IOC files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/ioc and the
# EPICS run-time files will be placed in $INSTALL_HOST/epics.

# The remaining definitions are IOC specific parameters used to configure the
# running of the IOC.
#
# All symbols beginning IOC_ will be written to the IOC configuration file
# which is stored to /etc/sysconfig/epics_ioc on Libera.

# All symbols beginning xx_IOC_ (where xx is any two character sequence) are

# Maximum number of points to be captured in a single long turn-by-turn
# waveform.  This will consume 32 bytes per point, so don't set it too long!
# A TT buffer of 0.5M samples is a good practical limit: this consumes 16MB
# of RAM, which we can afford, and gives us 0.5s of storage ring turn-by-turn
# data, which is ample.
